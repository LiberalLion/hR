The 'hR' package serves as a toolkit for data analysts, data scientists, and other analytics practitioners who address workforce-related problems. The goal of the package is to provide functions for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing people data in meaningful ways. Two functions are currently available, and more are on the way!  

Install the package from CRAN by running the `install.packages("hR")` command.
